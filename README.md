# getting-git

Using the git cli can be intimidating at times. It is not uncommon for beginners to get bewildered. It is also not uncommon for beginners to attempt to use a graphical application to attempt to simplify the complexity. Many of these applications assume an understanding of git upfront and use common concepts and language from the cli. This can also be a huge source of confusion as well but now you are one step removed from what is going on!

A better approach is to learn the basics of the cli and get comfortable using it for normal day to day tasks. You can then fallback to apps when a task becomes a burden from the command line. Common tasks like commiting changes, creating branches, obtaining changes from others and merging are a snap on the command line but resolving merge conflicts can be painful and visual apps can make it much easier to accomplish.

We will start with a set of exercises that will get you working locally with the git commandline interface. We will then progress to working with a remote source control system on GitHub.

1. [Local source control basics](local-basics.md) - In this set of exercises you will create and work with a git repository on your local machine.
2. [Remote source control basics](remote-basics.md) - In this set of exercises you will create and work with a git repository hosted on GitHub.
3. [Quiz](quiz.md) - The quiz will present common scenarios and ask you to write the cli command to accomplish a goal.
